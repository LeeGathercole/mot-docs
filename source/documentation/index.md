# Technical documentation

The MOT Testing Service (MTS) is used to record the results of vehicle tests, a legal requirement for vehicles in the UK.  The service has circa 55,000 external users in test centers plus DVSA internal users and records circa 120,000 tests per day.  On average their are 14,000 concurrent users of the service.

This is an up-to-date living document set for the MTS, broadly covering all technical aspects of the MTS, without delving too much into the detail.  Care should be taken to curate and maintain the validity of the documents it contains to avoid this repository becoming stale.  A GIT repository is being used, with markdown as the text format, to track activity and history and be exportable in the future should the need arise.

> There are a number of technical documents for the MOT Testing Service (MTS) that have varying stages of staleness, ranging between 1 and 5 years out of date.  This is mainly due to a lack of knowledge of those documents existance by the teams and the impedus to update them.  

The key areas coverered in this documentation set are:

* **Technologies** Technologies used within the MTS
* **Components** The key components of the MTS
* **Development** MTS software development concepts
* **Infrastructure** The deployment infrastructure
* **CI/CD** Continuous Integeration / Continuous Deployment
* **Testing** The various testing techniques and tools used
