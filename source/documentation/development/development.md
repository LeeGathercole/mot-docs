## Agile Development



## Open Source

Currently, we are regularly publishing the core MOT repo to GitHub but we are not coding in the open. This is a confidence-building measure. Specifically, MOT still relies on post-sprint security testing, and not every change that goes live is subject to security testing. Until we have corrected this, we will publish code only once it has been security tested. After we have built security testing into our pipeline, we will move to coding in the open.
